# About me
### I've worked coded in CSP for two trimesters, and am now working to understand how to code in python. I enjoy messing with code, and collaborating with others to get difficult tasks completed!
# Idea
### For our idea for the sponsored project, we first thought to make an utilities page for AP Stats, a class many of our group members were in. However, we found a better idea when we asked Mr. M, who needed to database of his students to remember what period they were in, their github and slack usernames, and their project.
# Project and Technical Plan
### So far, I have worked in the minilabs assigned in CSP, and have worked last trimester to try and create a better version of canvas. I have technical expertise in created APIs, since I have made a lot of them first trimester. I have struggled a bit with MVC second trimester, but will try my hardest to get things done and learn along the way.
# Create Task
