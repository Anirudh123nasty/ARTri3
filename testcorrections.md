### 12. To direct a call to the appropriate destination, which of the following input data is needed by the upgraded system that was NOT needed by the original system?
Audio signal of the customer’s voice
The customer’s keypad selection
The customer’s phone number
 
WRONG: C, which is I and III
 
RIGHT: A, which is I only 
 
While the customer's phone number is used in future calls to remember what they initially requested, it is not needed to redirect their call.

WRONG: B, Each packet contains an encrypted version of the data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing the key needed to decrypt the data.
 
RIGHT: A, Each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data.
